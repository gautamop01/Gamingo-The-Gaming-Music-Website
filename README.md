# Gamingo-The-Gaming-Music-Website
Here I am creating a gaming music website called Gamingo.

Hey everyone!

I'm excited to announce the newest addition to the main Website Gautam Gaming - Gamingo (The Gaming Music Website).

As a gaming enthusiast myself, I know how much music plays a vital role in enhancing the overall gaming experience. That's why I created Gamingo to provide gamers with an online platform where they can access some of the best gaming-related music tracks.

This website was created in January, but I've been working on other components in parallel. Now, I'm excited to announce that I have finalized this component and can't wait for you to check it out.

Currently, Gamingo features a collection of gaming music For now Gamingo is accessible on desktop devices, but I'm working on making it mobile-friendly and adding more songs soon. 

I can't wait for you all to check out Gamingo and discover some of the best gaming music out there.
